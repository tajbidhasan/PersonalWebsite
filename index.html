            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro"> I am a computer science student at Suffolk Community College. I am currently enrolled in
                the college's
                computer science program and transferring to Stony Brook University in Fall 2023. I have completed
                coursework in Intro to Computer Science and OOP in Java, and have experience with software design
                principles and OOP concepts. I have also gained experience with JavaFX for GUI development through my
                final project in OOP, which involved creating a GUI application to analyze and trade stocks from Yahoo
                Finance. I am currently learning about data structures and algorithms and have a strong foundation in
                problem-solving and critical thinking skills. In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the
                latest technologies and trends in the field. I am a motivated and self-disciplined individual, with a
                strong work ethic and ability to manage tasks effectively. I am excited to learn and grow as a
                programmer, and am looking for opportunities to gain practical experience through internships. Thank you
                for considering me for potential internship opportunities.</p>
